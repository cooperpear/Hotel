# Hotel
Hotel is an example of the power CSS3 can have over basic HTML design. It is fully responsive and is SEO optimized. 
Accessibility was a priority when implementing font, design, and color scheme.

## Deployed
https://cooperpear.github.io/Hotel/

## Built With
HTML5 <br>
CSS3

## Process
Converted graphic design of hotel website to HTML5 code, styled with CSS3.

## Areas of Expansion
This basic template could be expanded to include more pages. It also needs a backend for storing data from the contact input form. I would reccommend SQL database, firebase, or even a machine's local storage.
